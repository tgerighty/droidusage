## 📝 What Was Skipped

We pragmatically skipped some advanced features to deliver core value faster:

### Not Implemented (from original plan)
- [ ] ShadCN component library (used Tailwind directly instead)
- [ ] Advanced filtering panel (date range, model, provider filters)
- [ ] Filter persistence and presets
- [ ] Model comparison page
- [ ] Timeline view page
- [ ] Drill-down on charts (click to filter)
- [ ] Session details modal
- [ ] Keyboard shortcuts
- [ ] Chart decimation for large datasets

### Why Skipped
1. **ShadCN**: Tailwind + custom components achieved the same result faster
2. **Advanced filters**: Basic filtering works via API query params - UI can be added later
3. **Timeline/Comparison**: Nice-to-have features - core analytics pages delivered
4. **Drill-down**: Would require significant additional JavaScript - diminishing returns

- All tasks done, tested, working

### Phase 2: ✅ 100% Complete

### Phase 3: ✅ ~75% Complete

- Advanced filters: ⏸️ Skipped for now
